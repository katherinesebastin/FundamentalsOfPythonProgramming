**What was the most memorable thing about this task?**

The memorable thing about this task is how small details had to work together for the final output to be correct. This task showed it is easy to make mistakes when grouping data. One small typo is enough to break the program. It was a reminder that attention to detail and structure matters just as much as logic in programming.
